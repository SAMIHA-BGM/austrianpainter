# austrianpainter
A satirical timeline web project blending HTML/CSS storytelling, history, and design themes.  
This is a purely creative and educational exercise - not a political statement.

>>About the Project

This single-page website walks through the eerie rise and tragic legacy of a historical figure who started as a rejected artist and became one of history’s darkest names.

Sections:
- Origin        : The failed painter and forgotten years
- Rise          :  The talker, the rallies, the power-grab
- Führungswille : Control, propaganda, and the turning point
- Hate          : Racism, war crimes, and genocide
- **Fall        : Collapse, betrayal, death
- **Echo        : Digital aftermath, modern relevance, and caution

>>>  Built for design experimentation — not ideology.

>>Disclaimer

This is a **non-political** & **non-glorifying** project.  
The project’s intention is to **use web design to simulate a chilling narrative format**.  
It neither promotes nor sympathizes with any hate-based philosophy or historical regime.
