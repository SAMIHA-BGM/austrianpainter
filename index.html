    <div class="text-on-image">
      <p class="section-text">
        Born on April 20, 1889, in a quiet Austrian town
that gives serious Ohio energy —
no one knew this mid baby would cook up global DLC-level chaos.
No glitches, no grand prophecy. Just lagging vibes and fate bugging out.
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        His dad, Alois, was the OG gooner —
strict, mad controlling, walking red flag.
His mom, Klara?
An absolute NPC angel. She soft-launched Hitler's only ounce of humanity.
(Literally his last W.)
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        Young Adolf just wanted to be an <b><em>Artist</em></b>.
Like, fr. He thought he was HIM with the paintbrush.
But Vienna’s art school said “skibidi no” — twice.
No rizz, no portfolio, no future.
</p>

      <p class="section-text">
        Instead of slaying canvases,
he started slaying… well…
you know how that turned out.
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
Bro got denied an art degree and said,
“Fine. I’ll speedrun world domination.”
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        Maybe if someone had just bought one of his mid watercolor postcards,
we wouldn’t have had a whole war sequel.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        But alas.
Vienna fumbled.
And the villain arc began.

    <p class="section-text">
     Twice denied by Vienna’s art school, Hitler’s dream of becoming a painter collapsed. He lived in shelters, selling postcards — poor, angry, forgotten. Then came World War I. He enlisted, served bravely, and was wounded. But what hurt more was Germany’s defeat. He didn’t see it as loss — he saw it as betrayal.

      In 1919, still aimless gooner, he joined a tiny political group: the German Workers’ Party. When he spoke, people stopped to listen. He had passion, conviction — and hate. Within a year, he was leading it. They renamed it the Nazi Party.<br>

    <h2>Führungswille</h2>
    <p>
      Führungswille — the will to lead — became his doctrine, his drug, his destiny.<br>
      Power didn’t change him. It revealed him. The moment he became Chancellor, the theatre turned real. The masks came off.<br>
He silenced opposition beneath the smoke of the Reichstag Fire, then sealed it with the Enabling Act. Parliament remained, yes — but it now spoke in unison, echoing only him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gestapo arrived like whispers in the dark. Fear became law. Dissent became death.
Jews, communists, the disabled, journalists — anyone inconvenient was rebranded as infection. And the people applauded as the cure spread.
    </p>
    <p>He rewrote childhood. Mein Kampf became scripture. Swastikas replaced lullabies. Teachers became priests of ideology. The Hitler Youth did not march for truth — they marched for loyalty.</p>
    <p>Factories roared. Highways stretched like veins through a nation reborn. On the surface, Germany stood tall again.
But beneath — the soil was salted. And we, the living, stood in the shadow of a man who did not take power. He absorbed it. And demanded more.</p>
